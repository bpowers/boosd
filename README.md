gocalc - yacc calculator example in Go
======================================

gocalc is a transliteration of the integer calculator example in
Appendix A of [the original YACC
paper](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/) into a form parsable
by goyacc.  I did this mainly to get some experience with yacc, and
specifically goyacc (which doesn't have much documentation of its
own).  Hopefully it may be helpful to others as well.
